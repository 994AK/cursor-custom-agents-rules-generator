# Git Push Manual Rule

## Context

Used when user indicates they want to update all saved changes in git

## Critical Rules

- Run the command `git add .` from the root of the workspace
- Review all added changes that will be included in the commit
- Use format: `type: brief description`
- Keep titles brief and descriptive (max 72 chars)
- Add two new lines after commit title without newline characters
- Include diff short paragraph summary of all changes in commit body
- End with signature "-Agent Generated Commit Message"
- Push all to the remote current branch

## Examples

<example>
doc: explain recent rules changes in cursor

Changes made in this commit:

Updated the readme to include a better diagram showing rules workflow, while
also adding more sample rules to show rule folder organization. Specifically, notice that the change to `.cursor/rules/*folders` include readme.md files also to aid in understanding the folders purpose for human developers. AI gets its understanding from `.cursor/rules/rule-generating-agent.mdc` instead.
