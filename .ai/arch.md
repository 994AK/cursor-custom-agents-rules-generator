# Documentation Quality Improvement Architecture

## Overview
This document outlines the technical approach for implementing spelling corrections across the repository's documentation.

## Architecture Decisions

### 1. Documentation Structure
- Maintain existing file structure
- No changes to formatting or organization
- Preserve all technical content

### 2. Quality Control Process
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[File Selection] --> B[Identify Spelling Errors]
    B --> C[Technical Term Review]
    C --> D[Apply Corrections]
    D --> E[Final Review]
    E --> F{Meets Standards?}
    F -->|Yes| G[Mark as Complete]
    F -->|No| B
```

### 3. Tools and Standards
- Manual spelling review
- Technical term preservation
- Version control for changes

### 4. Implementation Approach
1. File-by-file spelling correction
2. Immediate commit after each file
3. Regular push to maintain progress
4. Pull request for each completed story

## Technical Requirements
- Only spelling corrections
- Preserve all technical terms
- Maintain existing file structure
- Follow project's commit conventions

## Approval Status
