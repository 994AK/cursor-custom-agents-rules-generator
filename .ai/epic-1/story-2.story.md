# Story: Fix Spelling Errors in xnotes Directory

## Overview
Fix spelling errors in all markdown files (*.md, *.mdc) in the xnotes directory while preserving all technical terms and meaning. Special procedures required as these files are gitignored.

## Status
- [ ] Draft
- [x] Ready for Implementation
- [ ] In Progress
- [ ] Complete

## Tasks
1. [ ] Create temporary working branch for xnotes files
   - Since files are gitignored, changes won't be tracked normally
   - Need to use `git add -f` to force add the files
   
2. [ ] Fix spelling errors in xnotes files
   - Review and fix all xnotes/**/*.{md,mdc} files
   - Preserve technical terms and templates
   - Document all changes made for later reference
   
3. [ ] Special git handling
   - Force add fixed files with `git add -f xnotes/**/*.{md,mdc}`
   - Create separate commit for these changes
   - Document procedure in PR for maintainer reference

4. [ ] Final review
   - Verify all spelling corrections
   - Ensure no technical terms were incorrectly changed
   - Check that meaning is preserved
   - Verify git handling procedures are documented

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All identified spelling errors are fixed in xnotes/**/*.{md,mdc}
- [ ] All technical terms preserved accurately
- [ ] No other content changes made
- [ ] Git procedures for handling gitignored files documented
